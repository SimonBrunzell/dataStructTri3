* Dopamine
> * determined the pleasure we experience
> * can lead people to unhealthy habits
> > * like the overuse of video games
> > * addiction
> > * rarely leaving the house
> > * leading people away from healthier options

* Pros of Video Games
> * Video games can inspire us to create
> * His struggle with video games led to him create a documentary illustrating his experience 
* Phone Trees
> * Led to innovations like
> > * Voice recognition
> * Improvements?
> > * Instead of calling back later they could also leave a message if the system can't identify the issue

***

1. Benefits and Harmful effects of computing 
> * Computing has led to automation which has made many tasks more accessible to people
> * Computing has allowed for disability aid beyond what could be reasonably accomplished via human aid
> * Computing has allowed for organization, making creation and creative based tasks easier for humans to thrive at

> > * Computing has made people more reliant on technology and less capable of themselves
> > * Computing has lead made it easier for children to expose themselves to negative influences
> > * Computing has made certain industries irrelevant and void of job opportunities 

2. Dopamine Issues
> I think the issues discussed above are genuine issues that need to be addressed. I think addiction is something that is way to often viewed as a choice, instead of the health concern that it really is. Addiction applies to more than drugs, and just like drug addicts, victims of addiction need help, not consequences. They need resources to better themselves, and the space to voice their struggle without judgement.

# 5.2 Notes

* Digital divide
> * Not everyone has equal access to technology
> * Some countries restrict access
> > * Not everyone has complete free access to information avaliable on the internet

> > * Factors include
> > > * Socioeconomic status, geography, education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity 
> * Some people like the Amish choose not to use technology 
> * In the start of the pandemic 90,000 children in new jerseybdidnt have access to computers cspable of distance learning

***

1. Digital Empowerment
> * People can empower themselves in the digital world by taking ownership of their space. By blocking those who cross boundaries, and by utilizing privacy features provided
> * You can empower others by educating them on features build into social media to keep them safe. By teaching them the mechanics behind owning your space, and basic online safety
> * I haven't personally encountered any red tape that has come between myself and digital empowerment. But nothing is perfect so I'm sure it exists

# 5.3 Notes

* Bias
> * Humans are error-prone
> * As well as biased
> > * Which leads to the creation of biased programs
> > * People’s ignorance can be seen through their code, with their beliefs influencing their algorithms
* Tiktok
> * Does use purposeful exclusion seen in their algorithm
> * People with identities that are controversial can become silenced in order to please a larger audience
> > * Unfortunately, many companies in order to market to the broadest audience end up silencing minority voices because of how political they are
* Voice Command 
> * Digital assistants have struggled with understanding accents or children
> > * I don't think this was purposeful
> > * However I believe it was due to lacking a diverse test team which was most likely due to bias, or best case convince, however, the issue of one group being more convenient is most likely indicative of a larger issue
* Netflix
> * I am not currently aware of any harmful effects of their algorithm
> * I believe it just genuinely caters content that it figures you like 

# 5.4 Notes

* Crowdsourcing
> * Allowing for reach beyond your community
> * Which helps reduce computer bias
> * Allows to obtain shared information
> * And participate in distributed computing

* Evidence
> * Allows for a mass collection of information
> > * Some of which can be wrong
> > * However these errors are often called out by self policing 

* Covid
> * By crowdsourcing you can easily gain a full understanding of how covid has effected the country as a whole
> * Which allows us to make informed decisions, backed by science
> > * Including mask mandates and other policies
* Obtaining data
> * Personal experience
> > * We have experienced crowdsourcing through our use of API's
> > * Github allows allows for crowdsourcing
> > > * Forking our code from our teachers in an example
> > > * Or exchanging code with fellow students

***

1. Crowdsource ideas 
> with 150 students this provides a lot of creativity and a lot of differing avenues of problem solving. By giving all 150 students a problem to solve and then giving them the time to all come up with their own solutions. We could then combine all of these ideas into a cohesive and efficient solution. Taking the best parts out of all of our ideas
2. Del Norte Crowdsourcing
> Because our project is based on the needs of del norte students. By gaining input from students here we could learn what they wished we prioritized or what change they would like to see in our program. They could give great insight into what changes they wish to see in our front end. But also features they wish we would implement which could influence our back-end as well. 

# 5.5 Notes

* Cost of Free
> * Qualcomm
> > * Makes their profit based off of patents
> > * Wants all derivative work to require a Royalty program payment
> > > * Anyone who uses the idea or patent must pay royalties 
> * GPL
>>  * General Public License 
>>  * Any work based on it is free
>>  * And code should be shared 
>>  * can limit your right to profit off of your creations bc they weren't completely original and based off of someone else's work 
> * Black Duck Software 
> > * An SCA
> >>  * software composition analysis 
>>  * Helps teams manage security quality and license compliance 
> > > * Due to risks that arise from open source and third party code
> * It's important to recognize the license of any code you are "borrowing" bc it could end up costing billions in business 
* Creative commons
> * A pathway to a license
> * Determining what kind of license you want?
> > * Do I want to allow commercial use or not?
> > * Do I want to allow derivative works or not?
> > * Do I want to require all code to be shared?
* Open Source MIT License
> * A license in which credit needs to be given
> * But they do not need to share usage
> * It will come with
> > * A read me
> > * EULA
> > > * End User License Agreement
* Open Source GPL License
> * Requires sharing all source code associated with the GPL
> * Sometimes code needs to be broken up, in order to preserve patents, and ownership,
> > * Put together it could be considered not theirs
* Legality and Ethics
> * Comply with terms of License & cite sources
> * Using code in class, usually isn’t an issue, because its for educational purposes


# 5.6 Notes

* Safe Computing
> * PII
> > * Personal identifiable information
> > * any data that could potentially identify a specific individual
> * PII considerations
> > * Safer options 
> > > * Name, picture, high school attended, college attended, credit report
> > * Gray Area
> > > * Birthdate, place of birth, street address, phone number, drivers license number
> > * NO!!!
> > > * Credential for access, two factor authentication, SS#, tax records

> > > * Is often sent through emails, and are installed after clicking on an attachment
> * Fishing
> > * When unknown sources entice you into responding
> > > * Like “click here for $500”
> > * In order to impersonate an official source asking for login information
> * Saftey Precautions
> > * Two factor authentication
> > * Requiring a code that has been texted or ematled to you
> > * Or biometrics 
> > * All ontop of a secure password
> * Symetric encryption
> > * Where only one key can encypt and decrypt personal information
> * Asymetric Cryptography (public key cryptography)
> > * A process that uses a pair of related keys, on private and one public
> > * to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use.

***
> I have seen my name on my about me page. Which has contained a fair amount of personal information. Information like our age, our interests, and groups we are a part of, as well as our age and pictures of ourselves.

> I feel fairly comfortable With my PII exposure due to the fact that I didn't share any information that could pose a threat to my safety or anything that's not able to be found with minimal work. I didn't share my street address, phone number, or tax records things that would be genuinely exposing. 

> A good password can be generated randomly that way someone can't figure it out simply by knowing you personally. A good password is also lengthier in length. A single word or short string of numbers is not secure. 

> Another step that can assist in authentication is two-step authentication. Requiring a second password that is sent to a separate device. That no one else has access to.

> Symmetric encryption is encrypted and decrypted with the same key. However asymmetric encryption is encrypted with one key and decrypted with another.

> A phasing scheme I learned the hard way was when my grandmother used to play these sketchy "Facebook" prize game. Where you spun a wheel to win a prize, however of course you needed to log in to claim your prize. Many other schemes consist of luring people in with flashy items and then using people's materialistic desires to fog over their common sense and deliver PII.
